This is a simple typing practice app made in node express and vite react.

To run the app, clone the repo (or download the zip), open in cmd or vs code, run "npm run installall" then "npm run start". The app should run fine.

To change the string characters or length of string, go to backend index.js file and change the character string.

This is still under making.
